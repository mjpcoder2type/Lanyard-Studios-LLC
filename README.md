# Lanyard-Studios-LLC
This is a small employee database for a fictional company called Lanyard Studios LLC.

I repeat, a FICTIONAL company.  Names, IDs and salary have all been pulled out of thin air.  Any similarities are coincidental and unintentional.  Except for Jerry Clower.  I used
his name as one of the entries because the guy was hilarious.  If you aren't familiar with him, look him up.  Liberty Mississippi's own!  Anyway I digress....

Once the program is loaded, you are presented with an option of ten employees.
You put in a number to select them and press ENTER.  From there you are presented with their full name....ID(also pulled out of thin air but has a pattern)...and their annual salary.

The code was basically a way to familiarize myself with data structures in C++.  In particular, classes.  

With whitespaces and all everything came to about 190 lines.  Tiny tiny program for this language.

Conditionals have been used in the chance that something out of order is input.  If and else was used and a switch statement was used to control selections.

I even used a c++ library that allows the use of exit() to simply exit the program.  To me this is a Godsend as it is the icing on the cake for an if then else situation.
Mostly because a void function can't return anything...ie return 0; is out of the question.

I consider data structures(aside from pointers which I am still mastering) to be a huge cornerstone of C++.  And consider them(data structures) a major cornerstone 
of ANY programming language.

As far as a license.  This is fictional and is a part of my educational journey.  If you can learn something from it in your own endeavors, have at it!  TL;DR No license.
